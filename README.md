# Qolsys Controller

[![Build](https://github.com/EHylands/QolsysController/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/EHylands/QolsysController/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A Python module that emulates a virtual IQ Remote device, enabling full **local control** of a Qolsys IQ Panel over MQTT — no cloud access required.

## QolsysController
- ✅ Connects directly to the **Qolsys Panel's local MQTT server as an IQ Remote**
- 🔐 Pairs by only using **Installer Code** (same procedure as standard IQ Remote pairing)
- 🔢 Supports **4-digit user codes**
- ⚠️ Uses a **custom local usercode database** — panel's internal user code verification process is not yet supported

## ⚠️ Certificate Warning

During pairing, the main panel issues **only one signed client certificate** per virtual IQ Remote. If any key files are lost or deleted, re-pairing may become impossible. 

A new PKI, including a new private key, can be recreated under specific circumstances, though the precise conditions remain unknown at this time.

**Important:**  
Immediately back up the following files from the `pki/` directory after initial pairing:

- `.key` (private key)
- `.cer` (certificate)
- `.csr` (certificate signing request)
- `.secure` (signed client certificate)
- `.qolsys` (Qolsys Panel public certificate)

Store these files securely.

## 📦 Installation

cd qolsys_controller
pip3.12 install -r requirements.txt

# Change panel_ip and plugin_ip in example.py file
python3.12 example.py
```
